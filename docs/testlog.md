# Testlog

## 12 Nov 2025

### General

- Focus on go live!
- de scope content! focus on just being the boilerplate template! Don't scope creap!
- so drop markdown and VS Code, swap cheat sheet to pandocs commands
- focus on the key purpose of this repo which is to creating a baseline that I then clone for each book - It's a template!
- implement CSS sooner than later! Because design implications
- Advise reader and define usage in this way
- add some basic git commands for template usage and as example chapters to be replaced.
- MAYBE: add kindle publish walk through to show how to go live.
- how write readme and then Kindle eBooks?
- design decision discussions in docs folder!
- in scope - how to that you could probably get from AI anyway these days.
- use of AI section.
  - ai not used except for when directly quoted.
  - Use of AI to transcribe voice recorded content? i.e. voice typing

### Research Questions

- Word count? Field in Pandoc?
- Page break front matter!
- Yaml meta in main file instead of as external works to create the ePub?
- css for ePub: check pandoc for direction.
- Add reference to conversion to Latex as a PDF pathway for the template?
- HTML fenced code?
- parts heading level?

### To do

- Add parts heading level
- Add CSS
- Docs folder - devlog and testlog? Detailed discussion of work and bug hunting.
  - testing issues/bug log and resolution.
- code samples! Use fence?
  - comments italic, keywords in bold, colour?
- Coloured tables?
- Kindle preview testing bug hunt
- add an html code fence example?
- Center chapters?
- initial chapter quote?
- number format? . After number?
- general text edit
- add a conclusion chapter - ask for review there.
- kindle create testing done for completeness not the intended workflow because of the limitations of KC for textbooks/tech guides.
- Paragraph indent and spacing? Is this CSS
- Explore Godot project docs git
- acknowledgements and attribution & creative commons request.
- junk text generation with lorum
- incremental build from training perspective
- i.e. this git has version branches - how do we explore those?
- look at pandoc reference to EPUB!
